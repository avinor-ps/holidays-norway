===

This repo was initially created by [Gunnar Forces](https://github.com/gunnar2k/holidays-norway) and then later [Khaliq Gant](https://github.com/khaliqgant/holidays-norway) forked to his profile and made a few code changes. And then the package used by other Avinor repos. Now, it's forked from Khaliq's repo under `avinor-ps` organization. 

A simple JavaScript library for listing the official holidays for Norway for any given year.  

# Installation

`npm install holidays-norway`

console.log(holidays(2015));
```

```

will output the holidays for 2015:
